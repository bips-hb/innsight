## Introduction

**innsight** is an R package that interprets the behavior and explains individual
predictions of modern neural networks. Many methods for explaining individual
predictions already exist, but hardly any of them are implemented or 
available in R. Most of these so-called *feature attribution* methods are
only implemented in Python and thus difficult to access or use for the 
R community. In this sense, the package **innsight** provides a common interface
for various methods for the interpretability of neural networks and can 
therefore be considered as an R analogue to 
[iNNvestigate](https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate) or 
[Captum](https://captum.ai/) for Python.

This package implements several model-specific 
interpretability (feature attribution) methods based on neural networks in R, e.g., 

* Layer-wise Relevance Propagation ([LRP](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130140))
  * Including propagation rules: $\varepsilon$-rule and $\alpha$-$\beta$-rule
* Deep Learning Important Features ([DeepLift](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685))
  * Including propagation rules for non-linearities: Rescale rule and RevealCancel rule
  * [DeepSHAP](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html)
* Gradient-based methods:
  * Vanilla Gradient, including [Gradient x Input](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/baehrens10a.html)
  * Smoothed gradients ([SmoothGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03825)), including
  SmoothGrad x Input
  * [Integrated gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)
  * [Expected gradients](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-021-00343-w)
* Connection Weights

Example results for these methods on ImageNet with pretrained network VGG19 (see
[Example 3: ImageNet with
**keras**](https://bips-hb.github.io/innsight/articles/Example_3_imagenet.html)
for details):
![vgg16](https://github.com/bips-hb/innsight/blob/master/man/images/Vgg19_result.png?raw=true)

The package **innsight** aims to be as flexible as possible and independent of a
specific deep learning package in which the passed network has been learned.
Basically, a neural network of the libraries
[**torch**](https://torch.mlverse.org/),
[**keras**](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) and
[**neuralnet**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neuralnet) can be passed,
which is internally converted into a **torch** model with special insights
needed for interpretation. But it is also possible to pass an arbitrary net in
form of a named list (see
[vignette](https://bips-hb.github.io/innsight/articles/detailed_overview.html#model-as-named-list)
for details).

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from CRAN and the development version
from GitHub with the following commands (successful 
installation of [`devtools`](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html) is required)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Stable version
install.packages("innsight")

# Development version
devtools::install_github("bips-hb/innsight")
```

Internally, any passed model is converted to a **torch** model, thus the correct 
functionality of this package relies on a complete and correct installation
of **torch**. For this reason, the following command must be run manually to 
install the missing libraries LibTorch and LibLantern:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
torch::install_torch()
```

> **`r knitr::asis_output("\U1F4DD")`  Note**  
> Currently this can lead to problems under Windows if the Visual 
Studio runtime is not pre-installed. See the issue on GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues/246#issuecomment-695097121) or
for more information and other problems with installing **torch** see the official
installation
[vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=torch/vignettes/installation.html)
of **torch**.

## Usage

You have a trained neural network `model` and your model input data `data`. Now
you want to interpret individual data points or the overall behavior by using
the methods from the package **innsight**, then stick to the following 
pseudo code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# --------------- Step 0: Train your model -----------------
# 'model' has to be an instance of either torch::nn_sequential, 
# keras::keras_model_sequential, keras::keras_model or neuralnet::neuralnet
model = ...

# -------------- Step 1: Convert your model ----------------
# For keras and neuralnet
converter <- convert(model)
# For a torch model the argument 'input_dim' is required
converter <- convert(model, input_dim = model_input_dim)

# -------------- Step 2: Apply method ----------------------
# Apply global method
result <- run_method(converter) # no data argument is needed
# Apply local methods
result <- run_method(converter, data)

# -------------- Step 3: Get and plot results --------------
# Get the results as an array
res <- get_result(result)
# Plot individual results
plot(result)
# Plot a aggregated plot of all given data points in argument 'data' 
plot_global(result)
boxplot(result) # alias of `plot_global` for tabular and signal data
# Interactive plots can also be created for both methods
plot(result, as_plotly = TRUE)
```

## Contributing and future work

If you would like to contribute, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

This package becomes even more alive and valuable if people are using it for 
their analyses. Therefore, don't hesitate to write me (<niklas.koenen@gmail.com>) 
or create a feature request if you are missing something for your analyses or 
have great ideas for extending this package. Currently, we are working on the following:

- [ ]  GPU support
- [ ]  More methods, e.g. Grad-CAM, etc.
- [ ]  More examples and documentation (contact me if you have a non-trivial
application for me)
